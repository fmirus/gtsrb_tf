# gtsrb\_tf

A tensorflow implementation of a CNN for traffic sign recognition using the [German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/) data-set.
This implementation is a single-column version of the network proposed by [Ciresan et al](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608012000524?via%3Dihub).
It is a re-implementation in [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) of an older version I have written using [keras](https://keras.io/) and [theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/).
